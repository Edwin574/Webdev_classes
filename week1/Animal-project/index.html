    <p>Animals are categorised into two:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Domestic Animals</li>
        <li>Wild Animals</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Domestic Animals</h2>
    <p>These are animals that have been tamed and kept by humans as a work animal, food source, or pet. They include :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Donkey</li>
        <li>Cat</li>
        <li>Cows</li>
        <li>Sheep</li>
        <li>Dogs</li>
        <li>Goats</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, lets take a look at some domesticated animals</p>

       of surviving on their own, whether it's in a forest or on city streets.</p>

    <h3>2.Cats</h3>
    <p>Domestic cats are characterised by supple low-slung bodies, finely molded
       heads, long tails that aid in balance, and specialised teeth and claws that 
       adapt them admirably to a life of active hunting.</p>
